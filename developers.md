# Signalen for developers and vendors

The Signalen team plans to start work on making Signalen open and reusable during spring and summer 2020. We're currently working on Amsterdam's Signalen repo, with the goal of moving Signalen to a separate master repo later this year.

Signalen is changing every day, but in the meantime we invite you to explore our code, have a tinker and give us feedback.

You can learn more about our work or contribute to Signalen at:

* [Amsterdam's Signalen Github repo](https://github.com/amsterdam/signals)
* [Signalen API spec](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/api/swagger/?url=/signals/swagger/openapi.yaml) and [API documentation](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/signals/)

## Vendors

We will need vendors that can help municipalities of all sizes get Signalen up and running, and keep it running, in a cost effective way.

We've already had interest from many VNG (Vereniging van Nederlandse Gemeenten, representing 355 municipalities) members, as well as Ghent (Belgium).

If your company wants to contribute to or join the Signalen project, email us at <signalen@publiccode.net>.
