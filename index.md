# Signalen

Signalen software helps cities manage and prioritize nuisance reports and other incoming public space data.

Signalen makes it easier for residents to make a nuisance report, and helps the city respond to the most important things first.

The Signalen teams' goals for 2020 are to:

* make the code reusable for other municipalities
* get the code into production at another municipality

## Built for Amsterdam

Built by the City of Amsterdam in 2018, Signalen handled 160,000 complaints in its first year. It replaced over 40 different reporting channels, which had previously been separately staffed.

## How it works

Signalen gives municipalities one integrated tool to manage and prioritize nuisance reports and other incoming public space data. It receives and combines reports, helps the control center (meldkamer) prioritize and manage issues, and can send jobs to other city departments.

Signalen is faster and more efficient because it:

* automatically classifies reports
* easily exchanges data with other systems

### Features

Signalen includes:

* a citizen facing form with dynamic fields based on nuisane complaint type
* algorithmic processing by type of complaint
* ability to combine complaints with other public space data, for example from IoT sensors on street furniture
* an administration interface to allow report triaging and management by the control center
* automatic alerts to city staff based on analysis of combined reports
* automatic updates to complainants about the status of their report
* rich data so city staff can analyze long term trends
* easy integration with other software systems, including municipal contractors

Signalen is an open source project - this means it's always being added to and improved.

## The Signalen teams

Amsterdam has had a Signalen team in place since 2018

[VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/) is working together with Den Bosch, Almere and the Amsterdam team to make Signalen fully reusable outside of Amsterdam.

The VNG team will start work in spring 2020.

This codebase is being stewarded by the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/).
